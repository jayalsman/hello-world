## newb learning the ropes

I am self-employed in the music /audio industry. I have been playing drums since the age of four, and I currently do freelance jobbing and session work as a professional drummer.
Stemming from my background in music, I have always been interested in the arts and the creative side of things, which brought me into my current field of study in graphic technology.
